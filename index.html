        Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But 
         <br>when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.
    </p>
    <p class="graph">We feel the same way about making Ableton products. 
        The driving force behind Ableton is our <br>passion for what we make,
         and the people we make it for.</p>

    <h6>Why Ableton - Juanpe Bolivar</h6>
    <p class="para">We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided <br>
         between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles <br> and Tokyo.</p>
    <p class="graph">Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We
         <br> come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are <br> 
        self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each <br>
         of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music <br>
         culture.</p>

       <p class="para">We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. <br> We only work on a few products and we strive to make them great.</p>
        <p class="graph">Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their <br>magic and grow.
             We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly <br> diverse, and thus able to explore problems 
             from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree <br> with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

        <p class="para">We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally passionate <br> about improving who we are.</p>    
   
    <p class="graph">We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally and professionally, <br>
        and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.  <br><br>
        Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge  <br>and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development  <br> and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices. </p>
